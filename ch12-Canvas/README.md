# Chapter 12 - HTML5 Canvas & SVG

Notes from [Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3 Training Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Training-Guide-Programming-JavaScript-Microsoft/dp/0735674388) by Glenn Johnson.

This is part of my study material for passing Microsoft's [Exam 70-480: Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-480.aspx) certification exam.

Prior to HTML5 we had to rely on something like Adobe Flash for drawing on a webpage. Now we have the ability to draw in HTML5 by using the `<canvas>` element.

We can display Scalable Vector Graphics by using the `<svg>` element. SVG is a language by which to define two-dimensional graphics in XML. The XML can then be rendered by the browser using the `<svg>` tag. Although you could learn and write SVG by hand, you will most likely use an image editor to create SVG graphics. The benefits of SVG is that they're scalable.

This lesson presents the `<canvas>` element and demonstrates drawing on the canvas. Then the lesson covers `<svg>` from an implementation perspective rather than from a drawing perspective.

# 1. Drawing with canvas
The only significant attributes that `<canvas>` has are the `height` and `width` attributes. The content you place in the `<canvas>` element is displayed if the browser doesn't support the canvas element.

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="800" height="600">
    You need a browser that supports HTML5!
</canvas>
```

The `<canvas>` element is invisible by default so we apply the following.

```css
canvas {
    border: 1px solid #999;
}
```

## 2. Canvas element reference
The `<canvas>` element exposes an abundance of functionality through its canvas context, which is accessible using JavaScript. The element provides the following members.

- **height** Property that sets or gets the height of the canvas
- **width** Property that sets or gets the width of the canvas
- **getContext()** Method that accepts a parameter of `2d` and returns a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` object that represents the canvas context
- **toDataUrl()** Method that creates a URL that can be used with an element that requires an image URL, such as the `<img>` element

## 3. CanvasRenderingContext2D context object reference
The `<canvas>` element is simply a graphics container; the context object that is returned from the `getContext` method is used to draw on the canvas. 

The following is a list of the context object's members.

- **addColorStop()** Method to set the colors and stop positions in a gradient object
- **arc()** Method to create an arc/curve
- **actTo()** Method to create an arc/curve between two tangents
- **beginPath()** Method to start a path or reset the current path
- **bezierCurveTo()** Method to create a cubic Bezier curve
- **clearRect()** Method to clear a given rectangle
- **clip()** Method to clip a region of any shape and size from the original canvas
- **closePath()** Method to create a path from the current point back to the starting point
- **createImageData()** Method to create a new, blank ImageData object
- **createLinearGradient()** Method to create a linear gradient
- **createPattern()** Method to repeat a specified element in a specified direction
- **createRadialGradient()** Method to create a radial/circular gradient
- **data** Property that gets an `ImageData` object that contains the image data
- **drawImage()** Method to draw an image, canvas, or video onto the canvas
- **fill()** Method to fill the drawing path
- **fillRect()** Method to draw a filled rectangle
- **fillStyle** Property that sets or gets the color, gradient, or pattern used to fill the drawing
- **fillText()** Method to draw filled text on the canvas
- **font** Property that sets or gets the font properties for text content
- **getImageData()** Method to get an `ImageData` object that copies the pixel data for the specified rectangle on a canvas
- **globalAlpha** Property that sets or gets the current alpha or transparency value fo the drawing
- **globalCompositeOperation** Property that sets or gets how a new image is drawn onto an existing image
- **isPointInPath()** Method that returns `true` if the specified point is in the current path
- **lineCap** Property that sets or gets the style of the end caps for a line
- **lineJoin** Property that sets or gets the type of corner to create when two lines meet
- **lineTo()** Method that adds a new point and creates a line from that point to the last specified point in the canvas
- **lineWidth** Property that sets or gets the current line width
- **measureText()** Method that gets an object that contains the width of the specified text
- **miterLimit** Property that sets or gets the maximum miter length
- **moveTo()** Method that moves the path to the specified point in the canvas without creating a line
- **putImageData()** Method that puts the image data from a specified `ImageData` boject back onto the canvas
- **quadraticCurveTo()** Method that creates a quadratic Bezier curve
- **rect()** Method that creates a rectangle
- **restore()** Method that pops the previously saved context from the stack
- **rotate()** Method that rotates the current drawing
- **save()** Method that pushes the state of the current context onto a stack
- **scale()** Method that scales the current drawing bigger or smaller
- **setTransform()** Method that resets the current transform to the identity matrix and then call the `transform()` method
- **shadowBlur** Property that sets or gets the blur level setting to use for shadows
- **shadowColor** Property that sets or gets the color setting to use for shadows
- **shadowOffsetX** Property that sets or gets the horizontal distance setting of the shadow from the shape
- **shadowOffsetY** Property that sets or gets the vertical distance setting of the shadow  from the shape
- **stroke()** Method to draw the path you have defined
- **strokeRect()** Method to draw a rectangle without fill
- **strokeStyle** Property that sets or gets the color, gradient, or pattern used for strokes
- **strokeText()** Method that draws text on the canvas without fill
- **textAlign** Property that sets or gets the alignment setting for text content
- **textBaseline** Property that sets or gets the text baseline setting used when drawing text
- **transform()** Method that replaces the transformation matrix setting for the drawing
- **translate()** Method that remaps the (0,0) position on the canvas

## 4. Implementing the canvas
When working with the `canvas` object, you must get a reference to the canvas context. This can be accomplished by using the `getContext()` method, which accepts a parameter.

Currently the values for the parameter are `2d` and `webgl`. WebGL focuses on more advanced three-dimensional drawing but this lesson will focus on the more mature `2d` parameter which returns a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` object. This object will be referred to as the _context_ object.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
    drawSomething();
});

function drawSomething() {
    var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.fillRect(10, 50, 100, 200);
}
```

In this example, `canvas` is a reference to the `<canvas>` element whose `id` is `myCanvas`. After that, `ctx` is set to reference the `context` object, with which you can start drawing.

The coordinates of the drawing surface are represented as `x`, `y` where 0,0 is the upper-left corner of the canvas

### Quick check
- What is the proper parameter to pass to the `getContext` method on the canvas to create two-dimensional drawings?

### Answer
- `2d`

## 5. Drawing rectangles
The methods for creating rectangles accept four parameters. The first two are the x and y locations of the upper-left corder. The last two parameters represent the width and height of the rectangle. You can create rectangles by using one of the following methods.

- **clearRect(x, y, w, h)** Clear the specified rectangular area.
- **fillRect(x, y, w, h)** Draw a filled rectangular area.
- **strokeRect(x, y, w, h)** Draw an unfilled rectangular area.

The following code demonstrates this.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
    drawSomething();
});

function drawSomething() {
    var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas'),
        ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'),
        offset = 15,
        clearOffset = 30,
        pushDownOffset = 10,
        height = 50,
        width = 100,
        count = 4;

    for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        ctx.fillRect(i * (offset + width) + offset, offset, width, height);

        ctx.clearRect(i * (offset + width) + (clearOffset / 2) + offset,
            offset + (clearOffset / 2) + (pushDownOffset /2),
            width - clearOffset, height - clearOffset);

        ctx.strokeRect(i * (offset + width) + offset,
            (2 * offset) + height, width, height);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `fillRect()` method is used to create four rectangles. Each is spaced horizontally by the offset amount. Next the `clearRect()` method is used to clear a rectangular area that is inside the filled-in area. Finally, the `strokeRect()` method is used to create a second row, but these rectangles are not filled in.
